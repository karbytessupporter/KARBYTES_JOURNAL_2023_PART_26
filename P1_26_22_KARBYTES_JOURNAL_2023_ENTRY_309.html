<p>I popped a little shroom cap on my way down Redwood Road. (Before that, while walking along Proctor Road was tentatively planning to use a well-lit and hidden &#8220;cave&#8221; at the closed senior community center but decided not to once it occurred to me that I will likely be working night shifts which end at approximately 2AM in Dublin and that is when the BART train stations are closed which means it would probably be easiest for me to make a habit of sleeping in Dublin). Once I got to Dublin I walked towards the well-lit and expansive mostly vacant corporate buildings because there are decent places to camp which have some degree of shelter from the rain and plenty of nicely landscaped courtyards with a nice view of the starry sky and decorated with what looks like bamboo and some bright green grass tufts. I was feeling better than earlier (and thinking about the like-minded friends I have started making online) had a very dream-rich sleep which included me getting a job in which I had to take home a large and expensive oven which needed to be pulled around by a wagon and which I started using on the side of the road to start baking fluffy croissant bread which magically grew orders of magnitude in size while I left it alone for about 30 minutes to go do some online paperwork on the steps to the entrance to a building which I and other college students were living. I was wondering whether or not to move my stuff to my bed which was located in a room with multiple other beds in it (which meant that the only space in that building I felt was mine exclusively was my bed) but I decided not to because I already had my stuff set up and was enjoying the outdoor weather but was worried I was being a nuisance to other people who were walking in and out of the building through the entrance I was sitting in front of. Then I hopped on a bus which had two female police officers on it and sitting in chairs in front of mine. The bus went up to some secluded mountain gate approximately a mile east of the student residence hall. A female guard said my name (Kar) out loud as if she knew who I was. I take that as a sign that I might as well be enlisted whether I know it or not to help serve the police or military. Then I woke up from that dream and saw that there was some man quietly reading a book at one of the stone tables in the courtyard I crashed at. Then I gathered my belongings, put my hair in a ponytail (because it is a hot summer-like day), and walked down the road to write this note (which I intend to publish as a blog post checkpoint to let my target audience know that I got out of the very bad mood I was in and that parts of my brain which seemed dormant have been revived such that my worldview currently feels a lot more wholesome, comprehensive, pro-social, and happy).</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m sitting in a nice shady area using the shopping center&#8217;s public Wi-Fi (because my &#8220;high speed&#8221; data with AT&amp;T ran out) drinking delicious coffee out of a glass bottle which has a taste reminiscent of rocky road ice cream. There are lots of little black birds (some with red shoulder &#8220;floaties&#8221;) in this area. Some are looking for crumbs beneath the tables. They decorate the scene with their chirping sounds.</p>
