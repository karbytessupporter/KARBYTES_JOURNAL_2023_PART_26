<p>I  have known people who apparently think that everything which is currently instantiated as a physical object is eventually and inevitably going to be demolished irreversibly. Such people seem to think nothing can be done to salvage any cherished pattern. Hence, those people seem to lack a sense of purpose in life because they seem to think life has no purpose without something worthwhile to preserve for an infinitely long period of time.</p>
<p>I am different than those people because <span style="background:#ffff00">I believe it is always hypothetically possible to verbatim transmit digital sequences representing any physical phenomenon which a human&#8217;s mind remembers from one universe to another universe through some kind of wormhole such that information loss resulting from the heat death of a particular universe can be avoided (provided there exist sufficiently intelligent information processing agents to do the job).</span></p>
