<p>Does a human adult have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human infant have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human fetus at six months old have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human fetus at three months old have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a month old human embryo have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a week old embryo have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human zygote have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human sperm have a mind?</p>
<p>(I think a human sperm has more agency than a human egg because, unlike a human egg, a human sperm has a locomotive apparatus and seemingly some degree of intelligent navigation system which enables it to traverse space-time and not merely wait passively to be activated from an external stimulus).</p>
<p>Does a human egg have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a human chromosome have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a strand of human DNA have a mind?</p>
<p>Does a molecule of human DNA have a mind?</p>
<p>(What I was thinking about earlier today with respect to a molecule of DNA is that, when the pattern which is physically instantiated as a particular permutation of atoms is swapped for a set of new atoms yet displaying the same pattern as the first set of atoms, that pattern is a rudimentary ego which undergoes reincarnation. <span style="background:#ffff00">That gives me hope that the ego which I (karbytes) am will similarly be reincarnated given the abundance of empirical evidence suggesting physical structures are fractal-like to varying extents).</span></p>
