<p>I have come to think of human beings as inanimate machines because I have reduced them down to their constituent physical components which are no more sentient than electronic computer components and not any more beautiful to me. Human beings are vehicles built by genes which are used by those genes to replicate themselves. All human emotion, thought, perception, and activity seems little more than a means to that end. That is why I do not think people truly care about anything. They just have electrical and chemical exchanges inside their nervous system which they hype up as caring. What they call love is what I call puppets convulsing mechanically in response to electrochemical throughputs.</p>
