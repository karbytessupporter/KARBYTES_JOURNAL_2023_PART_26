<p>While walking down Redwood Road today after spending the night and morning resting in a cozy little nook within a mile&#8217;s walk of where my house is located and on my way to get some coffee and munchies from the Castro Valley shopping center colloquially known as &#8220;The Village&#8221;, I caught a wiff of a combusted gasoline which had a distinctly unfiltered smell to it reminiscent of the way the interior of my dad&#8217;s old hippie van which he bought in the 1960s smelled. (My dad kept that van in driving condition up until my high school years. Then he sold it).</p>
<p>I imagine that if I grew up in the 1960s and was living in the United States of America I would also buy myself a van to live inside of (and also line the interior in the back with rugs so that it&#8217;s more comfortable to sit on than metal and I would probably decorate it with trippy artwork while keeping it minimalist). Today in the year 2023 everything seems to cost orders of magnitude more than it did just a few decades ago such that I have decided that trying to own a house or car or even rent an apartment is probably not worth my time. Instead, I would rather limit my working to part time jobs so that I have enough money to pay for my living expenses and hobbies while continuing to live out of a backpack and my dad&#8217;s house (until that gets foreclosed (which means I&#8217;ll probably resort to using 24 Hour Fitness as a place to take showers, public coin laundry mats as a place to wash and dry my clothes, a public mailbox at a UPS store have envelopes sent to (while using Amazon lockers to receive sufficiently small items which I ordered via Amazon dot Com and using stores like BestBuy to order gear to pickup in-store), and either my current residence address or else my parents&#8217; new residence address or else a homeless shelter&#8217;s address on forms which require me to enter my address of residence)).</p>
<p>Before I get to the main points of this blog post, I want to call attention to the fact that, while watching a short video on Instagram this morning about a wealthy technology tycoon investing millions of dollars on attempting to restore his body&#8217;s youthful vitality while adhering to a plant-based diet and very intensive self care routine, I felt encouraged by the way that guy said with confidence and optimism that he had plenty of supporters in addition to having many haters and how he loves the fact he has haters. I was inspired by the way that guy was motivated to keep doing what he is doing rather than de-motivated by unsupportive feedback from other people. Though I do not intend to go to such extremes to prolong my body&#8217;s longevity and vitality (and I am very interested in the prospect of replacing each of my body parts one at a time with either lab-grown organic replacement parts using my own stem cells or else synthetic parts which enhance my athletic, sensory, and cognitive functions and which enable my nervous system to directly and continuously interact with the Internet using a brain-to-computer interface), I do intend to adhere to a plant-based diet and upkeep my physical and mental fitness through regular exercise of my body and mind as a lifelong student and athlete (all the while knowing that I too will likely get unsupportive feedback from haters who normalize suboptimal functioning and who seem to demonize people for being as self-loving and affluent as I prefer to be).</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s get to the &#8220;meat&#8221; of this &#8220;meat and potatoes&#8221; blog post&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t make things like they used to,&#8221; is one paraphrased lyric from a song by Sezu (a band involving my mom as the bass player and Randy as the singer and song-writer). I don&#8217;t claim to know exactly what that song is in reference to, but I do think it might have something to do with how the cost of living has gone up much faster than has the quality of products and services which money is generally used to buy. This is the part of my journal entry I would highlight: <span style="background:#ffff00"><u>as human civilization progresses in time from the Industrial Age to the Information age with the relatively quick proliferation of computer technology and the Internet especially, human existence has been becoming less physical and increasingly digital. Deep down, I think literally everything is composed of information (including relatively physical objects such as cars, houses, and human bodies).</u> More and more of what I seem to value is being converted by me (i.e. karbytes) into digital files which are saved across a network of multiple Internet servers and offline solid-state storage media such as optical disks (and I fancy the idea of backing up each one of my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repositories on <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M-DISCs</a> which I keep inside of a metal safe for my peace of mind once I reach a point in my blogging career in which I feel that I am ready to take a hiatus or when I feel that my primary and secondary websites are in a relatively finalized state). Of course I intend to keep updating those websites for as long as I live (but the rate at which I make updates to those websites may eventually slow down to less than once per year after I get sufficiently old and seasoned at whatever my craft is (and at that point in my life I will probably turn into a full-time hermit who might as well be dead to society yet still alive and enjoying living relatively anonymously as some kind of hippie in or near the forest). Perhaps I will backup whatever I have in terms of GitHub repository content this year onto M-discs just to get the process started early so that I can make progress towards my goals as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00"><strong><em>Note that karbytes backs up each web page which is part of its personal websites to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> multiple times (with the goal of eventually backing up each one of those pages at least 100 times onto the WayBack Machine for the purpose of keeping those websites accessible on the public World Wide Web for as long as possible even if karbytes dies). It should be noted that karbytes does not intend to appoint any person but itself to manage those websites nor to manage those website&#8217;s preservation (but karbytes does hope that there will be people around to preserve what has already been saved to the WayBack Machine indefinitely into the future). karbytes hopes to get all that done before karbytes dies so that no one else has to do it. Finally, karbytes does have its own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://archive.org/details/@karbonbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">library page</a> on the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Archive</a> website (which is the website which hosts the WayBack Machine) where karbytes has uploaded its archived GitHub repositories (in the form of GitHub release zip files) and other miscellaneous files such as video and sound files.</em></strong></span></p>
