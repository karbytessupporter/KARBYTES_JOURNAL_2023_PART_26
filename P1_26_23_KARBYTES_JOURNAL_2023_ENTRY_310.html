<p><span style="background:#ffff00">While responding to those tweets and making this journal entry web page, I have been siting on the floor in the living room of my house next to the router (because the signal is fairly strong at that location whereas my room has a weak yet semi-functional Wi-Fi connection (probably due to there being metal and other materials in the walls of this house which impede the Wi-Fi signal)). To be clear, what I mean by self-identifying as both an extrovert and an introvert (to extreme extents), I mean to refer to the fact that I personally do not seem to mind being an &#8220;open book&#8221; which the general public (or at least law enforcement or the military) is able to observe the status of at all times (and I voluntarily share a lot of information about myself which I acquired through intensive introspection (which I think is definitively an introverted rather than extroverted activity)). Perhaps a good term to describe what I am like is an &#8220;extroverted introvert&#8221; (which is not the same thing as an &#8220;introverted extrovert&#8221;). I define an &#8220;extroverted introvert&#8221; to be someone whose sense of purpose in life and preferred mode of existence is solitary, cerebral, and quiet yet such a person may have adapted to being in an extrovert-centric society by mimicking the exhibitionist behaviors and thought patterns of what appear to be extroverted &#8220;normies&#8221;. Meanwhile, I would define an &#8220;introverted extrovert&#8221; to be someone whose sense of purpose in life and preferred mode of existence is in interacting with and being part of a community of other people yet such a person may have adapted to being in a more introverted role perhaps in order to deepen its understanding of subjects such as mathematics and engineering in order to have a deeper appreciation for existence and more to talk about with its friends.</span></p>
