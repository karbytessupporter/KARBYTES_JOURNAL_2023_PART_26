<p>I think that which I refer to as pig_gorl is a caricature of someone I know or someone I am supposed to be who seems to act like a histrionic daddy&#8217;s girl at my dad&#8217;s house and a more sassy, snooty version of whatever that is as my mom&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>I think pig_gorl is supposed to be my sibling rival who gets preferential treatment while I get treated like I am less valuable than she is (and pig_gorl surveils me constantly and attempts to always insert herself between me and whatever I want to focus on in order to ensure that I do not get to enjoy whatever that is and to ensure that pig_gorl remains the center of my attention).</p>
<p>Although I have documented my thoughts about pig_gorl quite extensively over the past two years within the journal entry web pages of this website, I feel that it is useful to provide a brief summary of her characteristics now: she is a cacophony of multiple audio tracks which overlap so as to create a continuous wall of noise (and that noise prominently features high-pitched and soft whimpering and plaintive vocalizations which are either nonverbal cries, hissing, lip smacking, and deliberately noisy mouth breathing or else are vague, petulant, and as hominem (towards me exclusively) verbal expressions). I should also note that pig_gorl seems to be perpetually &#8220;in heat&#8221; (in a state of being extremely ready, eager, and demanding to engage in erotic encounters). Finally (and despite thinking that psychology is little more than trite pseudoscience), I would diagnose pig_gorl as being an exemplar of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">histrionic personality disorder</a>.</p>
