<hr>
<p>I consider my previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry web page</a> to be satire rather than dogma which I feel ethically obliged to adhere to. After I wrote it, I walked to my mom&#8217;s house and then drove the Toyota Matrix which she said I could borrow to the East Dublin BART station parking garage at approximately 2:30AM. Then I walked over to one of my old camping spots and slept there for a few hours. At approximately 9:30AM I woke up and walked to the nearby Whole Foods Market to buy some healthy vegan food to eat and some gourmet canned coffee and vitamin-fortified sports beverages to drink. Then I drove the car back to my mom&#8217;s house and parked it in the driveway (while making sure to turn the wheels towards the curb so that the car would not roll down the hill if the parking break stops working). Then I went inside to feed Casey the cat and to say hi to my mom. What I intend to do now is resume not driving that car (because I feel that doing so violates my sense of personal ethics as an environmentalist and because I am worried about getting into a driving accident, getting the car broken into, having the car malfunction potentially dangerously while in use, and dealing with the expensive and time-consuming upkeep of the vehicle). I would much rather pay to rent an electric car for the occasions I plan on going out of the Bay Area for a road trip perhaps as soon as autumn or winter of this year. The <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_26/main/turo_tesla_rental_example_24_april_2023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshot</a> on this web page features what I consider to be a personally ideal car rental for my purposes. I also decided to include a Vox <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8682707/walking-biking-cities-transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> which was published on 29_MAY_2023 by Joseph Stromberg titled &#8220;Fewer than 4% of Americans walk or bike to work. Here&#8217;s how to change that&#8221; because I thought that article is sufficiently relevant to the topics broached in this journal entry web page. It should also be noted that I have been notified that my background check for the night stocker Whole Foods Market job which I applied for (at the same store I went to this morning) is complete but management requested that I answer some questions about some criminal convictions which are on my record. I saved that email conversation as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_26/main/gmail_whole_foods_market_background_screening_follow_up_24_april_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a> (i.e. Portable Document Format) file and uploaded it the GitHub repository which contains the source code and media files pertaining to this journal entry&#8217;s encompassing chapter. Another employment-related thing which happened today was that I got a phone call from the facility which processes my pre-employment drug test results for the part-time FedEx package handling job which I applied for in Dublin/Pleasanton which is within a mile of the East Dublin BART station. I was told that I tested positive for marijuana and that the test results have been released to FedEx as of today.</p>
