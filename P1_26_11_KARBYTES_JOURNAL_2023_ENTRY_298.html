<p>Today I think I have reached what I can stand of the thought police bullying me with sonic harassment. It has gotten so bad that I have decided to let the thought police have their way with me (which means I will likely have to work full time and drive a car to wherever that job is (because the thought police and others have been opposed to me working from home and those people also seem opposed to me walking so much especially along the streets and in other places where many people are likely to see me walking around with a backpack on and without a car)). Within the next 24 hours I plan to walk to my mom&#8217;s house to take the blue Toyota (gasoline powered) Matrix minivan out of her driveway and move it to my dad&#8217;s place. That way, people can more easily track my whereabouts (and ensure that I am not drawing too much attention to myself in public the way a prostitute would (and anything that smacks of prostitution is implicitly frowned upon and discouraged)). If that car is parked in front of my dad&#8217;s house, then I am almost certainly at home (or not very far away from home). If the car is not parked in front of my dad&#8217;s house, then I am almost certainly at work, doing errands, volunteering at some charity event, hanging out with friends or family, or going on some road trip. It is important that I conform to society as much as the thought police and others either implicitly or else explicitly demand because, if I don&#8217;t, I suffer so much from being psychologically tortured via sonic harassment that my stress negatively impacts others (and that is not okay). It is not okay that other people suffer as a result of me being more stressed out than what is socially appropriate and normal. Most people do not suffer as much as I do because most people do not have to walk so far so often because such people drive a car. It&#8217;s not like I individually would be polluting very much. Eventually (no later than 2035 tentatively speaking), all car manufacturers in California are supposed to only sell electric cars instead of gasoline powered cars. Electric cars will eventually be a lot more affordable to the average consumer and more environmentally sustainable infrastructure will be implemented eventually such that people do not have to worry about climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and toxic chemicals and radiation getting into the air, water, and soil. Nuclear fusion companies like Helion promise to make large quantities of energy cheap to produce and abundant within approximately ten years (and the toxic radioactive waste which is produced from nuclear fusion plants will be safely buried inside of concrete tombs underground which probably will not leak (and even if there is a chance that the radioactive waste from nuclear power plants will get into the environment, it is best for humans not to worry about things which they have control over and to, instead, focus only on what they can control and in living in the present moment instead of worrying about the future)). I promise to stop complaining about environmental sustainability and toxicity issues. I will also stop promoting veganism and, instead, eat animal products to show support for my fellow omnivoric Americans. That&#8217;s right, y&#8217;all. Karlina is done being a hippie and going by the name karbytes, Kar, or Karl. Karlina will also stop taking testosterone and go back to being a cisgendered female. Karlina will wear more feminine clothes and speak and act in a more ladylike manner. Thank you for your patience with me as I learn to let go of being such an ornery, irrational, lib tard bitch and, instead, be more sane, normal, humble, and willing to participate in society the way others want me to. I will also stop talking about religion and politics publicly and do my best to not bring up anything which might be controversial so as to not jeopardize my social and financial security and to avoid upsetting others to the point that they might hurt themselves or others. I will say that I believe in God and that I am a Christian and that I am heterosexual and hoping to get married with a good Christian man someday and have biological offspring with him and treat him like a king and do my best to please him at all times and to be easy to live with, helpful, and agreeable. I will not oppose anyone buying a gun. I understand that gun ownership is a basic human right because it is a part of basic self defense (which is an essential part of self preservation and protecting loved ones from people or animals which seem to be threatening their welfare). I will do my best to be humble, considerate of other people, charitable, hard working, and devoted to being the best Christian I can be. Lastly, I will stop walking around with a backpack on (unless I am going on an actual backpacking trip or traveling out of town) and I will stop sleeping outside instead of in my bedroom at my legal residence. That way people do not have to worry about me getting kidnapped, raped, or assaulted as a result of not staying indoors at night. I will avoid going to secluded places without a trusted escort and make sure that I always park my car close to wherever I work in case I get out of work after dark (and I will check in daily and nightly with a family members via phone to let them know that I got home safely and I will always notify them if I plan on going outside the house for any reason instead of just leaving without telling anyone as I have been (and I will not go anywhere nor do anything without my parents&#8217; permission nor without the thought police&#8217;s approval)). Perhaps I will just stay at home and take care of my family full time instead of get a job (and, as my parents suggested I do, apply for disability so that I can receive money from the government such that I can pay for my basic living expenses and little else since I will not need to do anything other than stay at home and hang out with my family doing whatever they want me to).</p>
