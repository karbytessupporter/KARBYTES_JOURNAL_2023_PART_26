<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_318</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Although I (karbytes) have mentioned the following policy in at least one previous journal entry web page on this website, I decided to reiterate that policy again in this journal entry web page (and I intend to share this journal entry web page on my social media pages in order to make this particular journal entry web page stand out from the others and relatively easy to reference): <span style="background:#ffff00">starting some time this month and continuing on indefinitely into the future, I have implemented a policy which mandates that I will neither edit nor delete a journal entry web page once that journal entry web page is added to this website by karbytes.</span></p>
<p><em>(To see a list of hyperlinks to each web page which is part of one of my personal websites arranged in alphabetical order, click on the menu button at the upper right corner of any web page of that website. That menu is a feature of the particular <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> theme which my websites each use (and that WordPress theme is named <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://wordpress.com/theme/intergalactic-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intergalactic 2</a> (and that theme was created by <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automattic</a>))).</em></p>
<p>I would also like to emphasize that all the content which comprises my personal websites (<a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) including web page source code, media files which are embedded in web page source code, and media files which are referenced via hyperlinks in web pages and hosted externally either in my GitHub repositories or in my personal Internet Archive library is licensed by me as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public domain</a> intellectual property. <span style="background:#ffff00">What that means is that anyone has my permission to (a) copy any of the content which comprises my personal websites, (b) modify any of that copied content, (c) distribute any of that copied and possibly modified content across any communication medium to any recipient, and (d) insert any of that copied and possibly modified content into one&#8217;s own art work (and one is free to license its art work and to control access to that art work however that person would like to).</span></p>
<p>My primary website (<a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is meant to serve as my professional portfolio as a lifelong student of physics, computing, philosophy, and art. <span style="background:#ffff00">Starting this year I have implemented a policy which allows me to modify or delete any web page which I add to my primary website before the end of the year in which I added that particular web page to my primary website. Once the year in which I added that particular web page to my primary website is over, that particular web page is no longer authorized by me to be modified or to be deleted (and a hyperlink whose visible content is the name of that web page and which links to that web page is required to remain on the table of contents section of my primary website&#8217;s home page with a fixed index number indicating website chronology).</span></p>
<p>My secondary website (<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is meant to serve as a record of my personal evolution and as a diary for exploring and sharing what I consider to be my most important thoughts. I intend for that website to become increasingly less redundant and increasingly less personally irrelevant as time moves forward. Up until this particular journal entry web page in that website, the content which comprises my online journal is what I consider to be &#8220;low quality&#8221; and repetitive compared to what I want my future journal entry web pages to showcase.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Finally, I would like to reiterate the fact that I intend to save each web page which comprises my personal websites to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> at least one hundred times in order to make sure that I have done everything in my power to permanently preserve my personal websites on the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a>. I hope to make my websites accessible between all the universes I inhabit and to maintain continuity of karbytes’ consciousness forever. I also hope to gather more empirical and logical evidence which supports the claim that death is merely an illusion and that unbroken continuity of an information processing agent’s consciousness is possible such that immortality is actually feasible to attain as an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>.</span></p>

Not every journal entry web page which karbytes publishes on this website is posted to karbytes’ social media by karbytes because karbytes wants to restrict its social media accounts to subject matter which karbytes thinks is “sufficiently relevant” to the general public (i.e. the whole of human civilization and other “sufficiently intelligent” entities wherever they might exist)</em></p>
