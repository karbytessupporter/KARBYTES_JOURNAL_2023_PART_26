<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Every day since I upgraded from free Twitter to Twitter Blue, I have been getting a notification each time I log into my Twitter account claiming that the login is occurring through a new device and at a location which is almost never the city where the login is occurring (and, until today, those cities were exclusively either Hayward, Oakland, Union City, Lathrop, or Sacramento). While sitting in my backyard past 9PM and logging into Twitter, I got a notification from Twitter saying that my location was unknown. Also while sitting in the backyard I used a simple drum track looper <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/sound_track_loop_counter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single web page application</a> which I published last year which does wonders to help calm down after listening to it (especially for sessions longer than ten minutes). Anyway, I decided to share a video (on my Twitter and Minds pages) of a group discussion on consciousnesses, artificial intelligence, and infants which I think is sufficiently relevant to the themes of this blog and which will be enjoyable for me to watch in its entirety once I am ready to settle into a cozy nook for a few hours. Tomorrow morning I plan to get to the Stoneridge Mall Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as soon as possible so that I can submit the medical paper work I completed today and which is allegedly due at 2PM tomorrow as part of the background check process for getting hired as a package handler at FedEx. I might not get the job because the drug test will almost certainly show that I had marijuana in my system and I was told that FedEx would disqualify me for that. Thankfully, I have what might be a better job at my favorite grocery store as a night stocker for higher pay and with a much less tedious and invasive background check procedure than what FedEx is asking me to go through. On a more &#8220;big picture&#8221; level, I am seeing some evolutionary progress occurring within this blog and within my own worldview. I see it becoming more expansive (which is helping to alleviate the sense of claustrophobia, myopia, monotony, and sense of being deprived of autonomy which seems to be induced or at least magnified by the Thought Police&#8217;s psychological torture tactics which both (a) forced me to quickly adapt to being in excruciating agony multiple times per day every day for years and (b) to provide counsel to a tireless, feisty, banal, irrational, sadistic <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPC</a> of a femme fatale which would have certainly gotten beaten up by some human by now if she were an actual flesh and blood human instead of a disembodied voice talking and responding to my &#8220;real time&#8221; thoughts in a manner which seems more deterministic and less open-ended than how <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> seems to respond to verbal inputs).</span></p>
