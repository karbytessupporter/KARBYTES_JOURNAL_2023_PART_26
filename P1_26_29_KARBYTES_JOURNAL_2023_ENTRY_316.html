<p>Within the past 24 hours I uploaded a video depicting my room to Instagram. Then I downloaded that video file and uploaded that video file to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_26/main/instagram_karbytes_28_april_2023_part_0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository which is associated with the chapter in which this journal entry web page is a part of and to my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://archive.org/details/instagram_karbytes_28_april_2023_part_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Archive</a> library page. I gave the Instagram video post the following caption:</p>
<p><em>As of 27_APRIL_2023, all of karbytes&#8217; physical possessions are in the room depicted by this video recording (which is less than $1,000 total).</em></p>
