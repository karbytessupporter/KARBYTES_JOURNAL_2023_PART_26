<p>I think there are people who want me to suffer a lot more than I think is necessary because such people think I deserve to be punished for not having enough friends and for preferring to be alone most of the time. Apparently my time deserves to be wasted and my quality of life deserves to be cheapened to the extent that I feel suicidal or homicidal unless a sufficiently high number of sufficiently conformist people are vote in favor of me existing without being ostracized and tortured.</p>
<p>While I am not opposed to having friends and being friendly towards strangers, I am apparently not as motivated as I ought to be to ingratiate myself to those who would grant me the right not to be treated like I&#8217;m less deserving of happiness than they are (and they are only allowed to be happy because they conform to rather than rebel against the military-industrial complex&#8217;s totalitarian regime to monopolize global fossil fuels reserves and other lucrative industries by enslaving foreigners to perform cheap and dangerous labor so that Americans can enjoy comparative luxury and consume more resources and pollute more than all the other nations combined).</p>
<p>Perhaps someday the military-industrial complex will have its way with me and I&#8217;ll start giving into its demands to be more like its conformists. I am not the only person who feels that it is being treated as subhuman merely for not using a gasoline  combusting car as its primary commute method like more than 95% of the local population does.</p>
